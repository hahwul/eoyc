The landing page is the first page visitors see. In Goyo, it's built using `landing.html` and configured in `content/_index.md`. This allows you to create a rich, engaging entry point for your project.

To create a landing page for another language, simply create a corresponding file, such as `content/_index.ko.md`.

## Template Configuration

First, ensure your `_index.md` file is set to use the `landing.html` template.

```toml
template = "landing.html"
```

## Full Configuration Example

The Goyo landing page is highly customizable through the `[extra]` section of your `_index.md`. Below is a full example showcasing all available sections. You can omit any section you don't need, and it won't be rendered.

```toml
+++
template = "landing.html"
title = "Goyo"

[extra]
version = "v0.1.0"

# Hero Section

        quote = "The best Zola theme for documentation out there. The setup was a breeze.",
        avatar = "/images/avatars/john.png"
    },
]

## Section Breakdown

- **`[extra.hero]`**: The main banner. It includes a title, description, a full-screen background image, and a list of call-to-action buttons (`cta_buttons`). Each button has `text`, `url`, and `style` (`primary` for the main button, `secondary` for the other).

- **`[[extra.features]]`**: A list of features to display in a grid. Each feature has a `title`, `desc` (description), and an `icon` from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).

- **`[extra.trust_section]`**: Showcases logos of companies or projects. `logos` is a list where each item has an image `src` and `alt` text.

- **`[extra.social_proof_section]`**: Displays user testimonials. `testimonials` is a list of objects, each with an `author`, `role`, `quote`, and `avatar` image.

- **`[extra.final_cta_section]`**: A final call-to-action block with a `title`, `description`, and a single `button` with `text` and `url`.
  You can also add an optional `image` field (e.g. `image = "/images/contribute.png"`) to display an image above the CTA text.
