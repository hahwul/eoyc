The `image_diff` shortcode allows you to visually compare two images side by side with a draggable slider.

## Usage

```
{{/* image_diff(src1="URL_TO_ORIGINAL_IMAGE" src2="URL_TO_CHANGED_IMAGE" alt="Description of image") */}}
```

- `src1`: URL of the original image (required)
- `src2`: URL of the changed/compared image (required)
- `alt`: Alternative text for both images (optional, defaults to "Image diff original" and "Image diff changed")

## Example

{{ image_diff(
    src1="/images/dark.jpg",
    src2="/images/light.jpg",
    alt="goyo"
) }}

This will render a draggable image diff viewer for the two provided images.
